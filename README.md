# leave-balance-service

Http service with an endpoint to calculate PTO/leave balance at the end of the year and how much will be lost if none is taken.

Dockerhub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/wdhowe/leave-balance-service](https://hub.docker.com/r/wdhowe/leave-balance-service)

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Building

Building parts of the project.

### Build Standalone Uberjar

The standalone uberjar can be built with lein and run with the java -jar command.

* Clone the project
* Build the uberjar

  ```bash
  lein uberjar
  ```

### Build Docker Image

The docker image can be built by:

* Clone the project
* Build the container

  ```bash
  docker build -t leave_service:mytag .
  ```

## Running

Different ways to run the service.

### Run With Lein or Jar

* Export environment variables for server settings if wanting to override defaults.

  Example
  
  ```bash
  # Max leave balance you can carry over each year (default: 200)
  export MAX_BAL=150
  
  # Port the http-server will listen on (default: 8080)
  export HTTP_PORT=8000

  # End of year (default: last day of current calendar year)
  # This setting may be useful if fiscal years are used instead of calendar years.
  export YEAR_END="2020-10-31"
  ```

* Run the http-server
  * With lein

    ```bash
    lein run
    ```

  * With the built uberjar

    ```bash
    java -jar target/leave-balance-service-0.2.1-standalone.jar
    ```

### Run With Docker

* Run pre-built image from dockerhub

  ```bash
  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name leave-service wdhowe/leave-balance-service
  ```

* Run locally built with default settings

  ```bash
  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --rm --name leave-service leave_service:mytag
  ```

* Run locally built with new env settings (change listening port and max balance)

  ```bash
  docker run -it -p 8000:8000 --env HTTP_PORT=8000 --env MAX_BAL=150 --rm --name leave-service leave_service:mytag
  ```
